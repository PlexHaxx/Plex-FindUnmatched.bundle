The Plex-FindUnmatched is a plugin for Plex Media Server, that will scan sections in the PMS database, and compare the medias found in there with the filesystem, listing medias that Plex are missing.


Work To Do:

 * Support sections that spawns more than one directory
 * Support scaked medias
 * Create some kind of output report for users. (Currently only feedback is in the log)
