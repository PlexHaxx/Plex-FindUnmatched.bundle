Added versionnumber to both Logfile as well as GUI
Added platform to logging
fixed backslash getting escaped on windows platform

V0.0.1.8:

Fixed a brainfart from my part, cutting off the last caracter in the html reporting

V0.0.1.7:

As a partial workaround for a channel timeout of the API, when scanning a HUGE section, I devided the search into 3 different steps.
Still not perfect, and will still timeout for some people, but as said, only with either a HUGE section, a non-optimized database or a slow file-system.
I'm still scratching my head here on how-to solve this, but haven't given up yet.

Fixed errors with strange caracters
Fixed issue when running on windows @ the same time...
(Looks like Unicode, that I hate, is also my friend here)
